HTTP apps are stateless. Once a response has been sent for a request, the connection is closed and server
has no knowledge of this request. If there was no way to link subsequent requests from the same user
using the same client then it would soon become very annoying for the user as it might mean they
have to be authenticated for each subsequent requests!

The server gracefully handles this by attaching a small piece of information to the outgoing response and
saving some details about this outgoing piece of information on its side in a session. A browser on the
other hand, saves the data from the server as a cookie and sends it back in subsequent requests. The
server then uses the information stored in the incoming cookie to lookup more details about the user.

The server can save the session data in different kinds of stores. To speed things when doing lookups
it can also cache session data. Out-of-the-box, Alpas supports File store and Memory cache driver.

### [Session Drivers](#session-drivers)

<a name="store-drivers"></a>
#### [Store Drivers](#store-drivers)

- `file` - Stores sessions as files under `storage/framework/sessions`
- `skip` - Doesn't save any sessions. Appropriate for API only web apps.

<a name="cache-drivers"></a>
#### [Cache Drivers](#cache-drivers)

- `memory` - Caches sessions in memory.
- `skip` - Doesn't cache any sessions.

<a name="configuring-sessions"></a>
### [Configuring Sessions](#configuring-sessions)

You can set the session drivers for your app by setting the appropriate environment variables.

<span data-file='.env'>

```toml

...
SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_CACHE_DRIVER=memory
...

```

</span>

> /tip/ <span> If your app doesn't need a session, maybe because it is an API only app, instead of setting
>the store driver to **skip**, you should just skip registering the `SessionProviderService` altogether
in your `HttpKernel` class. This improves the performance of your app.</span>


<a name="usage"></a>
### [Usage](#usage)

<a name="storing-data"></a>
#### [Storing Data](#storing-data)

`HttpCall`'s `session` object allows you to store a data in the current session.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="7">

```kotlin

fun index(call: HttpCall) {
    // Retrieve the session value for the given "key", if exists.
    // If not, returns the "default" value.
    call.session.put("key", "value")
    call.session.put(mapOf("key1" to "va1", "key2" to 5))
    //...
}

``` 

</span>

<a name="retrieving-data"></a>
#### [Retrieving Data](#retrieving-data)

`HttpCall`'s `session` object also allows you to retrieve a session data by its name.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="7">

```kotlin

fun index(call: HttpCall) {
    // Retrieve the session value for the given "key", if exists.
    // If not, returns the "default" value.
    val item = call.session.get("key", "default")

    // Alternatively, since the 'session' object is invokable, you can also do:
    val item = call.session("key")
    //...
}

``` 

</span>

To retrieve the data and then remove the data from a session, you can use `pull()` method.

If you want to retrieve an item if it exists but want to add it to a session if it doesn't then use: 

`getOrCreate(key: String, default: () -> T?): T?` or `getOrCreate(key: String, default: T?): T?`

<a name="checking-data"></a>
#### [Checking Data](#checking-data)

Use `has()` method to determine if the session has an item **and** that it is **not** null.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="9">

```kotlin
    
    //...

    if(call.session.has("key")) {
        // do something
    }

    //...

``` 

</span>

Use `exists()` method instead to determine whether the session has an item or not, **even if its value is null**.

<a name="deleting-data"></a>
#### [Deleting Data](#deleting-data)

Use `forget()` method with a list of keys for the items that you want to remove from a session. 

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="10">

```kotlin

    //...

    call.session.forget("key1", "key2", "key3")

    // To retrieve an item and then to remove it from the session:
    val item = call.session.pull("key1")

    //...

``` 

</span>


<a name="flashing-data"></a>
### [Flashing Data](#flashing-data)

You may sometimes want to store data in the session that are available only and only in the next request.
Think of [redirecting a user back](/docs/http-request#redirects) to the previous form with validation
errors or redirecting to a new page but with some messages. These kinds of data are best suited as
flashes. Whether you retrieve/pull these flash data or not, they are gone after the next request.

To flash some data, use `flash()` method. You pass tha name of the message as the first parameter
and the payload as the second parameter.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="7">

```kotlin

fun index(call: HttpCall) {
    //...

    // flash
    call.flash("message", mapOf("status" to "success", "message" to "Purchase completed!"))

    // Alternatively, for convenience, flash() method is also available on the controller itself
    flash("message", mapOf("status" to "success", "message" to "Purchase completed!"))

    //...
}

``` 

</span>

You would still use `session().get()` method to retrieve flash message as flash messages are just session items.

> /tip/ <span>If you want to keep all of your flash data for an additional request, use `reflash()` method.</span>

<a name="flash-template-helpers"></a>
#### [Flash Template Helpers](#flash-template-helpers)

There are a few flash related helpers available in your [Pebble templates](/docs/pebble-templates).

<div class="sublist">

- `flash(key, default)`

Retrieve a flash payload for the given `key`. If it doesn't exist then return the given `default` value.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="14">

```twig

<h1>{{ flash('success', 'Good job!') }}</h1>

```

</span>

- `hasFlash(key)`

Checks if a flash item for the given `key` exists.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="14">

```twig

{% if hasFlash('success') %}
<h1 class="green">{{ flash('success') }}</h1>
{% else %}
<h1 class="red">Oops! There was an error.</h1>
{% endif %}

```

</span>

</div>

> /alert/ <span>Most of the session related features are only available for the routes that
>have `SessionStart` middleware appliedâ€”either applied individually or using `web` 
>[middleware group](/docs/routing#named-middleware-group).</span>
