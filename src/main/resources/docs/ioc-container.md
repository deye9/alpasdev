[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) allows you to manage a class's dependencies
in a much cleaner way than the class itself creating and wiring them. Once you have set up the bindings, a class can
have the dependencies injected via a constructor. The proper use of dependency injection frees you from the hassle
of wiring all the dependencies. It also makes writing tests easier.

The dependencies don't always need to be get injected in your class via a constructor. If you have access to the
container that holds all the bindings, you could simply ask for instances of the dependencies. Depending on how
you have set up the bindings, you could either get a new copy every time you ask or could get a singleton
instance of a dependency.

Here is an example of a [config class](/docs/configuration) where a singleton instance of `Environment` class is
automatically injected via its constructor:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="3">

```kotlin

// configs/AdminConfig.kt
class AdminConfig(env: Environment) : Config {
    val adminEmail = env("admin_email", "admin@example.com")
}

```

</span>

In the following example, nothing gets injected in the constructor. Instead, we ask `HttpCall` to make an instance
of `AdminConfig`. This is possible because `HttpCall` is a container and hence it is very capable of resolving
dependencies.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="6">

```kotlin

// controllers/AdminController.kt
class AdminController : Controller() {
    fun show(call: HttpCall) {
        val adminConfig = call.make<AdminConfig>()
    }
}

```

</span>

### [Binding](#binding)

Binding is nothing more than putting a dependency into a container mentioning how you want to have it constructed.
All you need is the container that can be accessed from somewhere else so that you can ask the container for one
or more dependencies.

More often than not, you will be doing bindings from within [service providers](#/docs/service-providers) and
service providers are always injected the global app instance, which itself is an IOC container. You use
this app instance to register your dependencies.

<a name="simple-bindings"></a>
#### [Simple Bindings](#simple-bindings)

Register a binding on a container using the `bind` method and pass the java classname of the class you are trying
to bind.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="8">

```kotlin

    // StripePaymentProcessor.kt
    class StripePaymentProcessor(client: HttpClient) {
        init {
            println("StripePaymentProcessor instance Created")
        }
    }

    // HttpClient.kt
    class HttpClient {
        init {
            println("HttpClient instance Created")
        }
    }

   // PaymentServiceProvider.kt
   // ...
   override fun register(app: Application) {
        app.bind(HttpClient::class.java)
        app.bind(StripePaymentProcessor::class.java)
    }
   // ...

```

</span>

After above bindings, when you ask for `StripApi`, you'd get a new copy of it every time. A new copy of 
`HttpClient` is injected to `StripePaymentProcessor` constructor as well during the resolution.


<a name="singleton-bindings"></a>
#### [Singleton Bindings](#singleton-bindings)

To get one single shared instance of a dependency, you could use the container's `singleton` method.
A singleton dependency gets resolved only once.


<span class="line-numbers" data-start="8">

```kotlin

    // StripePaymentProcessor.kt
    class StripePaymentProcessor {
        init {
            println("StripePaymentProcessor instance Created")
        }
    }

   // PaymentServiceProvider.kt
   // ...
   override fun register(app: Application) {
        app.singleton(StripePaymentProcessor::class.java)
    }
   // ...
```

</span>

<a name="instance-bindings"></a>
#### [Instance Bindings](#instance-bindings)

If you already have an object instance and want to bind that instance, you could just use container's 
`bind` method for binding it. This instance will always be returned when asked for it. In a way this
is like a [singleton binding](#singleton-bindings) but without auto-injecting the dependencies of
this instance that you are binding, which is upto you now.


<span class="line-numbers" data-start="8">

```kotlin

   // PaymentServiceProvider.kt
   // ...
   override fun register(app: Application) {
        val processor = StripePaymentProcessor()
        app.singleton(processor)
    }
   // ...

```

</span>

<a name="abstract-bindings"></a>
#### [Abstract Bindings](#abstract-bindings)

Instead of binding a concrete class, you can also bind a concrete implementation to its abstract class or its
interface. This way you don't have to depend on a specific implementation of a class but only on the *APIs*
that you need from a class. When resolving you would refer to the abstraction instead of the concrete
implementation, of course!

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="10">

```kotlin

    // PaymentProcess.kt
    interface PaymentProcessor {
        fun process()
    }

    // StripePaymentProcessor.kt
    class StripePaymentProcessor : PaymentProcessor {
        init {
            println("StripePaymentProcessor instance Created")
        }

        override fun process() {
            println("Payment processed through Stripe")
        }
    }

   // PaymentServiceProvider.kt
   // ...
   override fun register(app: Application) {
        app.bind(PaymentProcessor::class.java, StripePaymentProcessor::class.java)
    }
   // ...

```

</span>

> /tip/ <span>Even with interface bindings you could either do [Simple Bindings](#simple-bindings),
> [Singleton Bindings](#singleton-bindings), or [Instance Bindings](#instance-bindings) based on whether you want a
> new copy, a shared single copy, or an object instance.</span>


<a name="factory-bindings"></a>
#### [Factory Bindings](#factory-bindings)

Instead of binding a class name or an instance, you could also bind a callback function that gets invoked every
time a dependency needs to be resolved. Just remember that the actual binding resolved is whatever the last
statement of this factory callback is.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="9">

```kotlin
   override fun register(app: Application) {
        app.bindFactory {
            println("StripePaymentProcessor factory binding called")

            // This is the actual binding. In this case we are returning 
            // a new instance of StripePaymentProcessor every time this 
            // factory callback gets invoked.
            StripePaymentProcessor()
        }
    }

    class StripePaymentProcessor {
        init {
            println("StripePaymentProcessor instance Created")
        }
    }
```

</span>

> /alert/ <span> Be careful binding "mutating" objects with the app container. Since these bindings will be shared
with all the incoming requests, if the bindings mutate their states, you might run into race conditions. For
these kinds of mutating global objects it is upto you to guarantee the thread safety of your app by taking
appropriate measures.</span>

<a name="resolving-dependencies"></a>
### [Resolving Dependencies](#resolving-dependencies)

There are two ways to resolve a dependency â€” via constructor injection or using `make` method.

<a name="constructor-injection"></a>
#### [Constructor Injection](#constructor-injection)

If a class depends on some other classes, it could just *declare* the dependencies in its constructor to get them
automatically injected. As long as this class itself is registered in the container, the container will be able
to resolve the dependencies including all the transitive dependencies.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="11">

```kotlin

    // StripePaymentProcessor.kt
    // An instance of HttpClient gets automatically injected
    class StripePaymentProcessor(client: HttpClient) {
        init {
            println("StripePaymentProcessor instance created")
        }
    }

    // HttpClient.kt
    // When resolving this class as a dependency of some other class(es), 
    // an instance of Logger class gets automatically injected as well.
    class HttpClient(logger: Logger) {
        init {
            println("HttpClient instance created")
        }
    }

    // Logger.kt
    class Logger {
        init {
            println("Logger instance created")
        }
    }

    // PaymentServiceProvider.kt
    // ...
    override fun register(app: Application) {
        app.bind(Logger::class.java)
        app.bind(HttpClient::class.java)
        app.bind(StripePaymentProcessor::class.java)
    }
    // ...   

```

</span>

<a name="make-resolve"></a>
#### [Using `make()`](#make-resolve)
Another way to have a dependency resolved out of a container is to use `make()` method. To resolve a dependency
using `make`, just like binding, you need a shared container that contains the bindings that you have wired.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="6">

```kotlin

// controllers/SubscriptionController.kt
class SubscriptionController : Controller() {
    fun show(call: HttpCall) {
        val processor = call.make<PaymentProcessor>()
    }
}

```

</span>

<a name="httpcall-container"></a>
### [HttpCall as a DI Container](#httpcall-container)

Just like `dev.alpas.AlpasApp`, `HttpCall` is a DI container as well. 
[`HttpCall` is created for every request](/docs/request-response#httpcall) but since it is a child container
created off of the app instance, any bindings that are registered in the app instance container is also
available from an `HttpCall` object. However, the reverse is not true â€” bindings registered in an
`HttpCall` instance are **not** available via app instance container.

Also, any bindings that are registered with an `HttpCall` object gets *closed* at the end of the call. This
is because an `HttpCall` is created for each request and gets closed when the request is fulfilled.

> /alert/ <span> Only add new bindings to an `HttpCall` if you want to share these bindings within the same
request lifecycle. These kinds of bindings are usually thread safe â€” but not guaranteed â€” as they are
only shared within one request call. </span>
