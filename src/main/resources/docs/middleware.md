A Middleware, as the name implies, sits in the middle of a request lifecycle and lets you intercept an
incoming request and act on it. Think of it as like filters that an `HttpCall` must pass through. 

For example, a logging middleware might log the details of an incoming request to a file, or an authentication
middleware might check the current session and decide whether to let a user continue or to return an error.
In fact, `dev.alpas.auth.middleware.AuthOnlyMiddleware` that Alpas includes does exactly that. Alpas
ships with many more such middleware.

### [Creating Middleware](#creating-middleware)

You create a middleware by extending `dev.alpas.Middleware<T>` class and overriding the `invoke()` method.
Alternatively, you can use `make:middleware` Alpas console command to create a new middleware and put
it under `middleware` folder.

```bash

$ alpas make:middleware AdminOnlyMiddleware

```

Let's say this middleware checks if the logged in user is actually an admin. If the checks passes,
it will forward the call but if not it throws an `AuthenticationException` exception.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="8" data-file="middleware/AdminOnlyMiddleware.kt">

```kotlin

class AdminOnlyMiddleware : Middleware<HttpCall>() {
    override fun invoke(call: HttpCall, forward: Handler<HttpCall>) {
        if (call.user.isAdmin()) {
            forward(call)
        } else {
            throw AuthenticationException()
        }
    }
}

```

</span>

This middleware can then be [applied to a route](/docs/routing#route-middleware) to make sure the route
passes through it.

Here's another example of a middleware that just does some logging.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="7" data-file="middleware/LogMiddleware.kt">

```kotlin

class LogMiddleware : Middleware<HttpCall>() {
    val logger: Logger = Logger()

    override fun invoke(call: HttpCall, forward: Handler<HttpCall>) {
        logger.info(call.referrer)
        forward(call)
    }
}

```

</span>

As you can see, a middleware doesn't always have to be "active" by taking an action on the call
but could be "passive"â€”doing something and forwarding the call.

<a name="before-after"></a>
### [Before/After Middleware](#before-after)

Inside of a middleware, you can decide what part of code gets run before a request hits a matching route
and what part of code runs after the request is handled. Any code before `forward(call)` call gets
run before and any code after `forward(call)` gets called after the call has been handled.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="7" data-file="middleware/LogMiddleware.kt">

```kotlin

class LogMiddleware : Middleware<HttpCall>() {
    val logger: Logger = Logger()

    override fun invoke(call: HttpCall, forward: Handler<HttpCall>) {
        logger.info("Hello! This runs before matching the route.")
        forward(call)
        logger.info("This runs after handling the call. Bye!")
    }
}

```

### [Registering Middleware](#registering-middleware)

<a name="route-entry-middleware"></a>
#### [Route Entry Middleware](#route-entry-middleware)

Route entry middleware are invoked for each request once the target route has matched but before invoking
the actual route handler. These middleware can be assigned to a [route](#/docs/routing#route-middleware),
to a [route group](#/docs/routing#group-middleware), or can be
[grouped together with a name](#named-middleware-group)
and then be assigned it to either a route, or a route group.

<a name="server-entry-middleware"></a>
#### [Server Entry Middleware](#server-entry-middleware)

Server entry middleware are invoked for each request regardless of whether the intended route matches or not. 
You can register a server entry middleware by overriding `HttpKernel#serverEntryMiddleware()` method and
adding the middleware to the list passed.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="18" data-file="HttpKernel.kt">

```kotlin

//...

override fun registerServerEntryMiddleware(middleware: MutableList<KClass<out Middleware<HttpCall>>>) {
    middleware.add(SecretServerMiddleware::class)
    middleware.add(SuperSecretServerMiddleware::class)
}

//...

```
